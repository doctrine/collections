/**
 * The missing (SPL) Collection/Array/OrderedMap interface.
 *
 * A Collection resembles the nature of a regular PHP array. That is,
 * it is essentially an <b>ordered map</b> that can also be used
 * like a list.
 *
 * A Collection has an internal iterator just like a PHP array. In addition,
 * a Collection can be iterated with external iterators, which is preferable.
 * To use an external iterator simply use the foreach language construct to
 * iterate over the collection (which calls {@link getIterator()} internally) or
 * explicitly retrieve an iterator though {@link getIterator()} which can then be
 * used to iterate over the collection.
 * You can not rely on the internal iterator of the collection being at a certain
 * position unless you explicitly positioned it before. Prefer iteration with
 * external iterators.
